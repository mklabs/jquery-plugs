jQuery-plugs
------------

A small collection of plugins I occasionally made.

# jquery-gtranslate
A tiny jQuery plugin to work with google translate api.

# jquery-harmony
a jQuery plugin wrapper on top of mrdoob's harmony application and based on pauliris's background edition. This plugin ease the integration on specific parts of a page whilst enforcing  proper sandboxing of harmony for each matched elements.
