###  jQuery harmony

jQuery harmony lets you simply add some harmony magic in your website!

Nothing fancy there, all the magic is done in harmony itself and Paul's Irish Harmony Backgroud edition. 
Really, I'm just a guy who put those awesomeness in a single file and wrapped it all in a jQuery plugin. 

Very, very, very, very first work.

Demo: [Demo](http//mklabs.github.com/jquery-plugs/jquery-harmony/)

## Basic setup:

- Import jquery-harmony.js
- Call $(selector).harmony(); A different canvas and a different instance of harmony will be used for each elements returned by the jQuery collections.
    
# Options
The only two options available are color and brush. This plugin supports for these two properties
inlined data, such as 
    <div data-foo="bar" />
    
Inlined data takes precedence on parameters object. If no inlined data are provided, the plugin will use 
the hash object provided if any.

## Color
Default is black. You can use either rgb (3-elements array) or hexadecimal  (1-element array) values. 

    $('.harmonify').harmony({
        color: [0, 0, 0] // or color: ["#000000"] for Hexadecimal values
    });
    
Or inlined:

    <div class="harmonify" data-color="255, 255, 255"></div>
    <div class="harmonify" data-color="#FFFFFF"></div>
    
## Brush
Default is Ribbon.

Available brush options value are:
    chrome, circles, fur, grid, longfur, ribbon (default), shaded, simple, sketchy, squares

    $('.harmonify').harmony({
        brush: 'chrome'
    });
    
Or inlined:

    <div class="harmonify" data-brush="chrome"></div>
    
## Credits
